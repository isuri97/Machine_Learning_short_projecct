# Language Model for NLP

If you are interested in **Natural Language Processing** then **Language Models** are very crucial and important part of NLP that you need to understand.

Before the advancement of machine learning, specifically deep learning, language models were built based on different statistical approaches like : the **n-gram based language model**, **hidden markov model**, **rule based NLP** etc.

Language models are so useful now a days that most of the big tech companies and their highly valuable products are using it extensively. **Google Assistant** , **Apple Siri**, **Microsoft Cortana**, **Amazon Alexa** all are using language models in different purposes.

Here in this blog-post I will cover the two types of language models which will be used for auto completion:
**1. Statistical Language Model :** We will design an **n-gram (tri-gram)** based language model using the pythonâ€™s nltk library and its own Reuters corpus.
**2. Neural Language Model :** Deep neural networks are the state of the art techniques and can be used in language model design. We will design a simple **LSTM** model which can be used for the same.
